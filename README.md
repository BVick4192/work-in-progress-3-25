Today is April 4th 2025. 
I found another bug now that I have a test jig with six sensors. 
Will take care of that tomorrow and then hand it over to the students to build the 24 channel, 
There are many incomplete niceties but I don't want help too much.
They'll have to figure out how to do velocity in software.
If they want to implement Midi controls to the synth they can do that too.
I plan on giving a class explaining the baseline software. 
it's based on open source code, no claim to any originality.
I'm impressed with the Arduino DUE Arm system. 
it's just downright fun.
4-7-25 Removed zener diode and added a DC bias for sensitivity trim. Test jig is running now.
